## 👋 Welcome to the SpiceDB community!

[SpiceDB] is an open source authorization system originally inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper].

### 💖 Authzed + Open Source

At Authzed, we believe that the software securing your systems needs full transparency: down to each line of code.
Because of our team's background of participating open source communities, our default is not only to freely license code, but also build a community that enables participation at all stages of development.

If you choose to contribute to any of our projects, we would love to have you.
If you like the experience and think you might want to do this full-time, you can [apply to work with us full-time]!
